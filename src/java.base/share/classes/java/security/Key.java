/**
 * The {@code Key} interface is the top-level interface for all keys. It
 * defines the functionality shared by all {@code Key} objects. All keys
 * have three characteristics:
 *
 * <UL>
 *
 * <LI>An Algorithm
 *
 * <P>This is the key algorithm for that key. The key algorithm is usually
 * an encryption or asymmetric operation algorithm (such as DSA or
 * RSA), which will work with those algorithms and with related
 * algorithms (such as MD5 with RSA, SHA-1 with RSA, Raw DSA, etc.)
 * The name of the algorithm of a key is obtained using the
 * {@link #getAlgorithm() getAlgorithm} method.
 *
 * <LI>An Encoded Form
 *
 * <P>This is an external encoded form for the key used when a standard
 * representation of the key is needed outside the Java Virtual Machine,
 * as when transmitting the key to some other party. The key
 * is encoded according to a standard format (such as
 * X.509 {@code SubjectPublicKeyInfo} or PKCS#8), and
 * is returned using the {@link #getEncoded() getEncoded} method.
 * Note: The syntax of the ASN.1 type {@code SubjectPublicKeyInfo}
 * is defined as follows:
 *
 * <pre>
 * SubjectPublicKeyInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
 *   algorithm AlgorithmIdentifier,
 *   subjectPublicKey BIT STRING }
 *
 * AlgorithmIdentifier ::= SEQUENCE {
 *   algorithm OBJECT IDENTIFIER,
 *   parameters ANY DEFINED BY algorithm OPTIONAL }
 * </pre>
 *
 * For more information, see
 * <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280">RFC 5280:
 * Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and CRL Profile</a>.
 *
 * <LI>A Format
 *
 * <P>This is the name of the format of the encoded key. It is returned
 * by the {@link #getFormat() getFormat} method.
 *
 * </UL>
 *
 * Keys are generally obtained through key generators, certificates,
 * key stores or other classes used to manage keys.
 * Keys may also be obtained from key specifications (transparent
 * representations of the underlying key material) through the use of a key
 * factory (see {@link KeyFactory}).
 *
 * <p> A Key should use KeyRep as its serialized representation.
 * Note that a serialized Key may contain sensitive information
 * which should not be exposed in untrusted environments.  See the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../specs/serialization/security.html">
 * Security Appendix</a>
 * of the <cite>Java Object Serialization Specification</cite> for more information.
