This repo began a fork of https://github.com/typetools/jdk. It now merges
directly from OpenJDK so that we can stay closer to HEAD and maintain only
nullness annotations, rather than the more extensive annotations used by
https://github.com/typetools/checker-framework. Still, much of its data comes
from the repository it was originally forked from.

This is not an officially supported product of any of the participant
organizations.
